## Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make with the owners of this repository via issue, email, or any other method
before making a change.

### Making changes

This extension should work both in Google Chrome and Firefox. However, the
extension manifests are slightly different. For debugging purposes, a symlink
to the proper manifest can be created:

`ln -s manifest.[chrome|firefox].json manifest.json`

There is no build process, just make your changes and reload the extension.
